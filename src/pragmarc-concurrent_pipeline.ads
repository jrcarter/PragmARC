package PragmARC.Concurrent_Pipeline is
   generic -- Transformers
      type Input  (<>) is private;
      type Output (<>) is private;

      with function Transform (Value : Input) return Output;
      with procedure Put (Item : in Output);
   package Transformers is
      procedure Put (Item : in Input);
      -- Blocks until the task doing the transforming is available
   end Transformers;

   generic -- Sinks
      type Input (<>) is private;

      with procedure Process (Item : in Input);
   package Sinks is
      procedure Put (Item : in Input);
      -- Blocks until the task doing the processing is available
   end Sinks;

   -- A package P that is an instantiation of one of these packages contains an internal task that waits until P.Put is called
   -- These tasks terminate via a terminate alternative
   -- If P is an instantiation of Tranformers, the task passes the value from Put to Transform, and passes the result of that
   -- to its generic formal Put
   -- If P is an instantiation of Sinks, the task passes the value from Put to Process
   -- Pipelines are built up in reverse: 1st the Sink, which provides the Put for the ultimate Transformer, which provides the Put
   -- for the penultimate Transformer, which provides the Put ...
   -- If Transform or Process propagates an exception, the processing for that input is silently ended and the task becomes
   -- available for another input

   -- An example of use is

   --  with Ada.Text_IO;
   --  with PragmARC.Concurrent_Pipeline;
   --
   --  procedure Test_CP is
   --     procedure Put_Line (Item : in Integer);
   --     -- Does a Put_Line to Current_Output with Integer'Image (Item)
   --
   --     package Sink is new PragmARC.Concurrent_Pipeline.Sinks (Input => Integer, Process => Put_Line);
   --
   --     function Length (Item : in String) return Integer is (Item'Length);
   --
   --     package To_Length is new PragmARC.Concurrent_Pipeline.Transformers
   --        (Input => String, Output => Integer, Transform => Length, Put => Sink.Put);
   --
   --     type Int is range -2 ** 15 + 1 .. 2 ** 15 - 1;
   --
   --     function Image (Item : in Int) return String is (Item'Image);
   --
   --     package To_Image is new PragmARC.Concurrent_Pipeline.Transformers
   --        (Input => Int, Output => String, Transform => Image, Put => To_Length.Put);
   --
   --     -- This is a pipeline that takes an Int and calls Put_Line on the Length of its Image
   --     -- The Length for the 1st value can be processed by Put_Line while the Image of the 2nd is having its Length found
   --     -- and the 3rd is having its Image made
   --
   --     procedure Put_Line (Item : in Integer) is
   --        -- Empty
   --     begin -- Put_Line
   --        Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Item => Integer'Image (Item) );
   --     end Put_Line;
   --  begin -- Test_CP
   --     To_Image.Put (Item => Int'First);
   --
   --     Near_Zero : for I in Int range -10 .. 10 loop
   --        To_Image.Put (Item => I);
   --     end loop Near_Zero;
   --
   --     To_Image.Put (Item => Int'Last);
   --  end Test_CP;

   -- When run, this produces

   --  $ ./test_cp
   --   6
   --   3
   --   2
   --   2

   -- What does this gain us? In this example, nothing, really, except to show how this package is used
   -- However, when the transformations are lengthy and many inputs may be available before one is completely processed,
   -- such a construct allows several inputs to be processed concurrently
end PragmARC.Concurrent_Pipeline;
